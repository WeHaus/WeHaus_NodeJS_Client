    w.create_module('12341234');

## Create Device

Of type SensorDevice with endpoint number 1.

    w.create_device('SensorDevice',1);

## Instantiate Device

With an instance of WeHaus and the endpoint number. It has to be created on the API before. You need to create it only once.

    let sensor_temp = new SensorDevice(w, 1);
